"i am seriously so disgusted with the service. I ordered some products worth Rs 1300 and i have been trying for days to return two of the products, one of which has a hole in the bottle. I have been struggling to get a proper response and approval of my return request. Why do you mention ""Easy return policy"" when you won't even approve a customer's request. I WANT TO RETURN THE PRODUCTS AND GET MY REFUND ASAP!",0

"Bad experience  I've ordered like one shampoo and conditioner from morocconoil brand bcz another app or shopping app doesn't have this brand but they didn't shipped my order they just cancelled it and I just ordered another s&c in another shopping app and they literally came in one week. So nykka doesn't provide good services and even I've ordered so much stuff from here but they didn't shipped my orders they just cancel them.So I requested to shipped my recent order I hope.also I've ordered organix oil and they delivered me a lipstick which is not my order, I'll never buy anything from nykka again and I'm pretty sure. I hated this app + everything.",0

Very disappointed with Nykaa's customer service. I've received damaged products from Nykaa three times and return experience is a true hassle and is not simple with them requesting for multiple photos of damaged products and you having to chase customer care multiple times for the return to be processed and followed up.,0
It's very helpful in guiding you about the products and it's review. Also offers original products at minimum rate. Enjoyed my experience with nykaa and wish to continue it.,1
Very Nice App!,1
Great products & ranges. Thanks to nykaa,1

"Recently I had a very bad experience with Nykaa, the product which was delivered to me was not what I had ordered and inspite of getting in touch with them several times ,they have done nothing about it. In fact I have already made a payment for the product ordered which is much more than the wrong product delivered to me. I am feeling very cheated. I would advise not to use this app since they do not bother about what is being delivered or about responding or even having the wrong product exchanged!!!! BAD EXPERIENCE!!",0

"there is nothing wrong with their beauty products but their other services are pathetic. 1.the delivery guy doesn't even call or send message before delivering the product. 2.we know that in some places your delivery guy is not allowed to enter but atleast they can come till the gate of the area, they just send message that my address is ineligible for delivering the products. my friends are also having this kind of problem, i reported but they don't even care about their customers.",0

DO NOT GIVE YOUR DELIVERIES TO BLUDART. I request you to stop giving deliveries to bludart. They never deliver on time. They lie about not being able to reach while in reality they don't even attempt to deliver. The app itself is quite good if not being delivered by BLUDART. My order is 5 days late because it was being delivered by them. I will change my ratings as soon as this issue resolves. And I will not get anything from here if I keep receiving late stuff from bludart like this.,0

Nykaa is my go to app when it comes to cosmetics and beauty products. The products at Nykaa are absolutely genuine and there are always some amazing offers going on.

"After being such a big platform nykaa fail to do justice with their employees and small content creators who are collaborating with them, its more of a barter system. Employees are judged for their financial condition, mental health and what not. Have often received expired freebies from them.",0

"I had ordered a product recently and it turned out to be a damaged product. Unfortunately I wasn't around to open the package untill today and I found it that way. When I tried to raise concerns, neither nykka could provide me a solution nor I could navigate to the product to write a review. I have been a customer to nykka since a long long time and keeps on purchasing zillion products, why would I raise a concern so petty if it wasn't genuine? Extremely disappointed!",0

Again troubled in return. For a single return I have to make them 3 calls with 2 mails but no satisfactory reply. Return not approved. Their return policy and services is worst . On the top of that if u have made payment through your bank account but after returning an item they return your money in nykaa wallet so. Worst service. Highly disappointed. Please no one will use this site . Noo my issue is not yet resolved. refund amount is in nykaa account instead of in the account from which payment,0
